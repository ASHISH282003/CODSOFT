Data Science-Projects

Description:

A collection of Data Science projects showcasing my skills in data analysis, modeling, and prediction.

Projects:

1. Titanic Survival Prediction: Built a predictive model using logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest algorithms to determine which passengers were most likely to survive the Titanic disaster.
2. Movie Rating Prediction with Python: Developed a machine learning model to predict movie ratings based on user reviews and attributes, utilizing natural language processing and sentiment analysis techniques.
3. Credit Card Fraud Detection: Created a fraud detection system using supervised learning algorithms to identify and prevent potential credit card transactions, ensuring secure financial transactions.

Technologies:

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, NLP)
- Datasets: Titanic Dataset (Kaggle),IMDb India Movies (Kaggle), Credit Card Fraud Dataset (Kaggle).

Objective:

Demonstrate my proficiency in machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization by tackling diverse projects and sharing my solutions with the community.
